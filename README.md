# Weather-Dashboard

This is a repository that details a Weather Dashboard connecting into a third party API. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. For this Weather Dashboard, I utilized the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to pull in their weather data.

On the far left side of the application, the user can see what they have previously searched for. This will prevent any duplication upon searching for a specific city. The icons that appear within the dashboard are also pulled in from the OpenWeather API. This element enhances the overall structure of the dashboard as the user can clearly identify good weather from poor weather.

One challenge I had to overcome when constructing this application was overcoming how to display the weather criteria correctly. By adhering to a simple formula using Jquery, I was able to traverse the DOM and place those elements where they should be.
